### Heya !

<--
My name is Nick, and I am a computer science student. I'm currently learning Java and Git.
The goal for me in learning Java is to develop the practical skills it takes to read, write, and understand code, so that I can learn, explore, and practice software engineering fundamentals. And to have some fun : ) !
