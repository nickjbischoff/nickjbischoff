### Heya !

<--
My name is Nick, and I am a computer science student. I'm currently learning Java.
The goal for me learning Java is to gain the practical skills it takes to read, write, and understand code, so that I can learn, explore, and practice software engineering fundamentals. And to have some fun : ) .
